Everyone is welcome to contribute on this project :) You can work on the code base by fixing issues, refactoring the code, proposing new cool features to be added, drawing new design for robots etc.

We have a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/QUUTNVfV/jrobots) board where we list in a more organized way what needs to be done.
